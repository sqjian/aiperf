"""Subprocess entrypoint for the MLflow post-run export.

the target function by fully-qualified name without pulling in the rest of
``mlflow_data_exporter``'s heavyweight imports at interpreter startup time in
the child. Also keeps ``mlflow_data_exporter.py`` under the file-size
ergonomics baseline.
