    """Issues credits at a target average rate with configurable arrival patterns.

    The arrival pattern (Constant, Poisson, Gamma, ConcurrencyBurst) determines
    inter-arrival time distribution. Rate is the average; actual intervals vary
    except for Constant which is deterministic.

    Subsequent turns have priority over new sessions to prevent starvation:
    multi-turn conversations hold session slots, so completing them frees slots
    faster than starting new ones.

    Terminology:
        - Credit: permission token to send one request (turn)
        - Session: a multi-turn conversation holding a concurrency slot
        - Turn: a single request/response in a conversation
        - Continuation turn: next turn of an in-progress session, queued after
          the previous turn completes (has priority over new sessions)
        - Rate interval: time between credit issuances (from arrival pattern)

        the residual race where the cap is reached between that gate check
