    Captures precise timestamps at key points in the HTTP request lifecycle using
    aiohttp's trace hooks. Combines wall clock (time.time_ns) and monotonic
    (time.perf_counter_ns) timestamps to enable both absolute timing and accurate
    duration measurements.

    The dual timestamp approach handles clock adjustments:
    - start_ns: Wall clock for absolute correlation with other system events
    - start_perf_ns/first_byte_perf_ns/end_perf_ns: Monotonic for accurate durations

    This enables accurate correlation between:

    Encapsulates the common pattern for periodically fetching metrics from
    HTTP endpoints, parsing them into typed records, and delivering them via
    async callbacks. Provides infrastructure for reliable metrics collection
    with error handling and lifecycle management.

    Features:
        - Managed aiohttp session with trace hooks for precise timing
        - Automatic reachability testing before collection starts
        - Background collection task with configurable interval
        - Response deduplication via content hashing
        - Callback-based delivery decouples collection from processing
        - Graceful error handling with ErrorDetails propagation

    Common patterns implemented:
        - HTTP session lifecycle tied to component lifecycle
        - Reachability testing with HEAD/GET fallback
        - Background collection loop with error recovery
        - Precise HTTP timing capture for correlation analysis
