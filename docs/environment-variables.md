# Environment Variables

AIPerf can be configured using environment variables with the `AIPERF_` prefix.
All settings are organized into logical subsystems for better discoverability.

**Pattern:** `AIPERF_{SUBSYSTEM}_{SETTING_NAME}`

**Examples:**
```bash
export AIPERF_HTTP_CONNECTION_LIMIT=5000
export AIPERF_WORKER_CPU_UTILIZATION_FACTOR=0.8
export AIPERF_ZMQ_RCVTIMEO=600000
```

> [!WARNING]
> Environment variable names, default values, and definitions are subject to change.
> These settings may be modified, renamed, or removed in future releases.

## CLI RUNNER

CLI runner post-run callback behavior. Controls whether OnComplete callback exceptions abort the run after all callbacks attempt or are isolated and logged. Default is isolated so that a single misbehaving callback (e.g. auto-plot in strict mode, third-party hook) cannot bypass the deliberate ``os._exit`` hang-protection that guards against multiprocessing/ZMQ teardown hangs in the parent process.

| Environment Variable | Default | Constraints | Description |
|----------------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `AIPERF_RAISE_ON_CALLBACK_ERROR` | `False` | — | When true, re-raise the first OnComplete callback exception after running all remaining callbacks but before os._exit. Provides a strict-mode contract where a callback raise propagates out of the runner. When false (default) the exception is logged with full traceback, the exit code is forced non-zero, and the process still terminates via os._exit so leftover ZMQ/multiprocessing state cannot hang the interpreter. |

## APISERVER

API server settings. Controls the host and port of the API server.

|----------------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `AIPERF_API_SERVER_HOST` | `'127.0.0.1'` | — | Host to bind the API server to |

|----------------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `AIPERF_DAG_FAIL_FAST` | `False` | — | When True, abort the whole run on the first DAG child error (cancel pending siblings, raise to PhaseRunner, terminate phase). Default False - the orchestrator counts the error in BranchStats.children_errored, releases the join slot, drains pending siblings, and continues the run. Set via AIPERF_DAG_FAIL_FAST=1 for strict CI assertions. |

## DATASET

Dataset loading and configuration. Controls timeouts and behavior for dataset loading operations, as well as memory-mapped dataset storage settings.

## HTTP

HTTP client socket and connection configuration. Controls low-level socket options, keepalive settings, DNS caching, and connection pooling for HTTP clients. These settings optimize performance for high-throughput streaming workloads. Video Generation Polling: For async video generation APIs that use job polling (e.g., SGLang /v1/videos), the poll interval is controlled by AIPERF_HTTP_VIDEO_POLL_INTERVAL.

| `AIPERF_HTTP_VIDEO_POLL_INTERVAL` | `0.1` | ≥ 0.001, ≤ 10.0 | Interval in seconds between status polls for async video generation jobs. Lower values provide faster completion detection but increase server load. Applies to the aiohttp transport. |

## SEARCHPLANNER

Adaptive-search planner tunables. Controls precision targets, warmup-phase injection, and request-count presets for the smooth-isotonic and monotonic SLA-saturation search planners. All values are read at planner-construction or iteration-mutate time, so changes take effect on the next search run.

| Environment Variable | Default | Constraints | Description |
|----------------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `AIPERF_SEARCH_PLANNER_SLA_PRECISION_DEFAULT` | `0.05` | > 0.0, &lt; 1.0 | Default SLA boundary search precision target. The bisection / smooth-isotonic bracket halts when (infeasible_min - feasible_max) / infeasible_min < this value, and the cliff detector requires bracket_gap > this * x_hi to report a cliff. 5% mirrors perf_analyzer's --binary-search default. |
| `AIPERF_SEARCH_PLANNER_DEFAULT_WARMUP_SECONDS` | `30.0` | > 0.0, ≤ 100000.0 | Smooth-isotonic SLA planner: default warmup phase duration in seconds injected into each iteration's cfg when ``cfg.sla_warmup_seconds`` is unset. Spec calls for max(30s, 3*inter-batch-time) but inter-batch-time is unknown at planner-time, so 30s is the safe floor. Must be strictly positive: zero defeats the cold-KV-cache rationale that motivates the floor. |
| `AIPERF_SEARCH_PLANNER_FIRST_PROBE_WARMUP_FLOOR` | `60.0` | > 0.0, ≤ 100000.0 | Smooth-isotonic SLA planner: minimum warmup duration in seconds for the first probe at each swept-dim value. Cold KV-cache and CUDA-graph compilation cost is largest the first time we hit a given concurrency, so floor that probe at 60s. Must be strictly positive: zero defeats the cold-KV-cache rationale. |
| `AIPERF_SEARCH_PLANNER_REPLICATE_WARMUP_FLOOR` | `15.0` | > 0.0, ≤ 100000.0 | Smooth-isotonic SLA planner: minimum warmup duration in seconds for replicate probes at an already-probed swept-dim value. Replicates reuse the warm KV-cache / CUDA-graph state, so a shorter warmup suffices. Must be strictly positive: zero defeats the floor. |
| `AIPERF_SEARCH_PLANNER_SLA_PRECISION_REQUESTS` | `{'tight': 10000, 'normal': 1000, 'coarse': 300}` | — | Mapping from ``cfg.sla_precision`` preset name to the ``phases.profiling.requests`` value injected when the user did not set ``requests`` explicitly on the profiling phase. Drives p99 CI width. Each value must be strictly positive — zero/negative request counts surface as iteration-time failures otherwise. Override via JSON, e.g. ``AIPERF_SEARCH_PLANNER_SLA_PRECISION_REQUESTS='{"tight": 20000}'``. |

## SERVERMETRICS

## DEV

Development and debugging configuration. Controls developer-focused features like debug logging, profiling, and internal metrics. These settings are typically disabled in production environments.

| Environment Variable | Default | Constraints | Description |
|----------------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `AIPERF_DEV_DEBUG_SERVICES` | `None` | — | List of services to enable DEBUG logging for (comma-separated or multiple flags) |
| `AIPERF_DEV_ENABLE_YAPPI` | `False` | — | Enable yappi profiling (Yet Another Python Profiler) for performance analysis. Requires 'pip install yappi snakeviz' |
| `AIPERF_DEV_MODE` | `False` | — | Enable AIPerf Developer mode for internal metrics and debugging |
| `AIPERF_DEV_SHOW_EXPERIMENTAL_METRICS` | `False` | — | [Developer use only] Show experimental metrics in output (requires DEV_MODE) |
| `AIPERF_DEV_SHOW_INTERNAL_METRICS` | `False` | — | [Developer use only] Show internal and hidden metrics in output (requires DEV_MODE) |
| `AIPERF_DEV_TRACE_SERVICES` | `None` | — | List of services to enable TRACE logging for (comma-separated or multiple flags) |
