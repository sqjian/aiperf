"""Integration test: aiperf plot --mlflow-upload round-trip.

Validates the end-to-end workflow:
1. Run `aiperf profile --mlflow-tracking-uri file://<tmp>` to produce
   artifacts and create an MLflow run.
2. Run `aiperf plot --input-dir <output> --mlflow-upload` against the same
   tracking URI.
3. Assert:
   (a) Both commands use the same run_id (live-run reuse rule from Property 6).
   (b) The MLflow run artifacts directory contains at least one plot file.
   (c) The plot upload does not rewrite mlflow_export.json.
