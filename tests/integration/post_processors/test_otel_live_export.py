"""Integration test: live OTel metric export arrives before run completion.

Regression coverage for Requirement 7.1 (flush starvation). Under sustained
load the fanout process must flush metrics to the OTel collector on a
monotonic-clock schedule, not only at shutdown. This test spins up a fake
OTLP HTTP sink, runs a real `aiperf profile` against the in-repo mock
server, and asserts that the sink receives at least one POST /v1/metrics
*before* the profiling run declares completion.
