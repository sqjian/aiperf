"""Integration test: MLflow live metrics land correctly in the tracking store.

Extends ``test_plot_mlflow_upload.py`` (which covers the plot-upload round
trip) with a live-streaming correctness assertion. Runs ``aiperf profile``
with ``--mlflow-tracking-uri file://<tmp>`` and then inspects the MLflow
filesystem store directly:

    * At least one ``live.*`` metric key was written.
    * Each metric file contains multiple data points (more than one step).
    * Steps are monotonically non-decreasing within a metric key.
    * Each step's MLflow timestamp is monotonically non-decreasing within
      the key (i.e. ordering preserved through the fanout queue).
    * The ``benchmark_id`` MLflow tag matches the ``aiperf.benchmark.id``
      recorded in ``mlflow_export.json`` — the correlation key that lets
      post-run exporters and dashboards stitch live + deferred data.

Uses the filesystem store because it's self-contained; the code path that
writes the metrics is the same for any backend.
