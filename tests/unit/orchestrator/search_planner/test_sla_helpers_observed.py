"""Tests for SLA-helper unmeasurable-path diagnostics.

The SLA-aware planners (``smooth_isotonic``, ``monotonic_sla``) latch
``infeasible_min`` whenever ``first_failing_filter`` returns ``observed: null``
and terminate with ``no_pass_in_range``. Pre-fix, that null collapse was
silent: a production sweep against ``nemotron-super-vllm-agg-frontend:8000``
on DGX 2026-05-06 hit it with no log line naming the failing metric tag,
because the SLA filter happily returned ``observed: null`` whether the
metric was missing, the stat was None, or all runs failed.

The fix logs which of those three branches fired with the offending
metric_tag/stat, so a single grep against the sweep-controller pod tells
oncall whether the file is genuinely missing TTFT, the percentile is
absent, or every run died before measurement. The regression test below
fences each branch.
